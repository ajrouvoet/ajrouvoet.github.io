    description: >
      My research at the TU Delft was about using programming languages to
      increase software reliability. In particular, I looked at formal verifcation
      of software safety. Using a computer assisted method we develop mathematical
      proof that certain software is safe to execute. Unlike testing, this
      approach can guarantee the absence of certain errors and is especially
      useful for critical software and in domains where testing is very difficult.

      My research at the TU Delft is published in multiple papers at top
      international (open-access) journals of computer science.

    description: >
      At S&T I developed software to process, archive and visualize atmospheric measurement data.
      I worked on the entire software stack including distributing the processing of the data,
      deployment of the software services, and front-end and back-end web-development.
      I've designed and prototyped various innovations in this software stack to utilize
      modern technologies and make the deployment reproducible.

      At Occator I worked on the visualization and interaction with planning data from
      production at clients such as Friesland Campina, OTG, and Grolsch. I designed and prototyped
      the architectural change that was necessary to support their transition to a much
      more interactive planning tool.
