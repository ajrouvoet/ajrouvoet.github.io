  summary: >
    I enjoy solving problems with software. I work best in <strong>big problem spaces</strong> with
    many challenges on the road ahead. I like to understand the root problems and to
    <strong>drive innovation</strong> to solve those problems. To make this work,
    I like to <strong>teach</strong> and
    mentor people, and I like to get involved in the process beyond the technical
    development to align the organisation on a <strong>vision</strong> for the product or service.
    I believe that the organization and <strong>transfer of
    knowledge</strong> is the key challenge in the fast-paced world of software
    engineering.

    It is important for me to work on something that is <strong>relevant to society</strong>. I believe
    that we need to transition to a more sustainable and fair future and I want to
    contribute.

  prive: >
    On a more peronsal level: I'm 32 years old and married to Irene, who is
    an elementary school teacher in the Utrecht area. In my free time, I
    work on minor house renovations, I play chess online, and I enjoy
    bouldering and indoor soccer. I read a lot—both fiction and
    non-fiction—as a source of inspiration and leisure.

experience: >
    As a software developer, I am not tied to any particular programming
    language.  I have experience with many mainstream languages (<strong>Java, Kotlin,
    Scala, C#, Python, Javascript & friends, C, ...</strong>), as well as off-beat ones
    (<strong>OCaml, Haskell, Agda, ...</strong>). I have worked with relational and
    unstructured databases (<strong>MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL</strong>), with various web frameworks
    (<strong>Laravel, Django</strong>), frontend frameworks (<strong>React, Angular</strong>),
    devops tooling (<strong>NixOS, docker, Vagrant</strong>),
    and, naturally, version control systems (<strong>Git, SVN</strong>).

    As a software architect, I like to work from a vision for a product or
    service that is firmly grounded in technical reality, and that encompasses
    the whole user experience. This means that I like to help think about
    marketing and sales aspects so that the positioning of and communication
    around the product align with the technical aspects. At Occator and S&T I
    took ownership of the technical aspects to implement an existing vision, and
    at Riscure I helped develop a new vision in a small team that also
    implemented it.

    I'm an <strong>experienced writer and speaker</strong>, having published and presented
    multiple papers at top scientific conferences of my field.  I enjoy writing
    and presenting and use it to share knowledge in my teams and organisations.
    For example, at Riscure I maintained a blog to document and share the vision
    and architecture that I developed.  At the TU Delft, I taught an MSc course
    on <strong>Software Verification</strong>.

    During my PhD trajactory at the TU Delft I also learned to <strong>design and
    execute research</strong>. I have learned how to make progress and estimate effort
    under uncertainty. I am aware of the state of the art in programming
    language design and tooling, as well as state of the art <strong>techniques for
    producing highly reliable (or even formally verified) software</strong>.

role: >
    I have experience in industry (at @WalmartLabs, Occator, S&T, Riscure), but also
    as a researcher (PhD candidate and postdoc at TU Delft). In the latter
    role I learned to analyze large open problems and to
    prototype and communicate new solutions.
    I hope to find a position that values the skills that I developed in that time.

functions:
  - when: "2013–current"
    where: "Riscure"
    what: Senior Software Engineer
    description: >
      At Riscure, I worked on an innovation project to analyse embedded C to identify security
      vulnerabilities. I helped formulate a new technical vision to shape the product offering
      and future development, and I produced the software architecture to support the implementation
      of this vision. I helped the team transition from Java to Kotlin as we filled in the design.

  - when: "2017–2021"
    where: "TU Delft"
    what: PhD Computer Science > Software Engineering Dept.
    how: Cum laude, awarded to top ~3% of CS promovendi in Delft
    description: >
      My research at the TU Delft was about using programming languages to
      increase software reliability. In particular, I looked at formal verification
      of software safety. Using a computer assisted method we develop mathematical
      proof that certain software is safe to execute. Unlike testing, this
      approach can guarantee the absence of certain errors and is especially
      useful for critical software and in domains where testing is very difficult.

      My research at the TU Delft is published in multiple papers at top
      international (open-access) journals of computer science.
      As part of the research I designed and implemented various programming languages.
      I also taught and assisted in various MSc courses and supervised BSc and MSc students.

    description: >
      At S&T I developed software to process, archive and visualize atmospheric measurement data.
      I worked on the entire software stack including distributing the processing of the data,
      deployment of the software services, and front-end and back-end web-development.
      I've designed and prototyped various innovations in this software stack to utilize
      modern technologies and make the deployment reproducible.

      In my master thesis project I worked on a mathematical formalization
      of implicit resolution in the Scala programming language.
      The goal of such a formalization is to improve our understanding of the language
      to improve the implementation and evolve the language.

      more interactive planning tool.
