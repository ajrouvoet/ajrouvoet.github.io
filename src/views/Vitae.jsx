                Although I have experience in industry (at @WalmartLabs, Occator, and at S&T), my most recent position

                In this role I learned to analyze large open problems and to prototype and communicate new solutions.
                I hope to find a position that values the skills that I developed in that time.

            My research was about using programming languages to increase software reliability in various ways.
            For example, we developed new languages to model complicated domains more concisely and safely.
            We also study how to improve general purpose languages through language design and tooling to
            prevent, for example, common bugs and security leaks. This means I have a lot of experience with:

            Besides the understanding of programming languages and software development in the large that I
            acquired through my research at the TU Delft, I also have hands-on experience with software in
            industry. In all my jobs I have been a <strong>driving force behind innovation, architecting and
            prototyping change</strong> to more modern or capable technology. An important aspect of my work has always
            been to bring teams along with these changes, so I consider knowledge transfer an important and
            enjoyable part of innovation. Through these projects I obtained hands-on experience with various
            technologies, tools, and programming languages, such as:
