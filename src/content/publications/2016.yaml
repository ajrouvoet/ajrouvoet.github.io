  abstract: >
    Implicit resolution has been part of the Scala language for a while, but the formal system
    it constitutes and its properties have not been formalized. Oliveira et al. were the first
    to formalize a calculus of implicits λ⇒ based on the ideas of implicits in Scala. We
    propose a stronger calculus λS⇒, extending their results and closing the gap with the
    maximum achievable expressiveness of resolution on top of System F. We believe that
    the strengthened results provide new insights into implicit resolution and are a big step
    towards a formalization that is entirely faithful to Scala.

    We give a partial algorithm for λS⇒ and use a proof-technique proposed by Abel & Altenkirch
    to establish its soundness and partial completeness independent of termination.
    To ensure that our results are correct and that it can be extended in the future, we made
    the language and proofs precise in the Agda dependently typed language.
