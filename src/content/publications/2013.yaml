  title: Systematic Testing of Hardware Compilers
  subtitle: Testing the DWARV C-to-VHDL Compiler

  abstract: >
    DWARV is a C-to-VHDL compiler which can compile arbitrary C programs for a
    heterogeneous platform with minimal effort. Depending on the application
    this will imply faster execution. We give an overview of C-to-VHDL
    compilers. One important aspect of all software is its reliability, and we
    aim to assess DWARV’s reliability and the adequacy of its test suite. Based
    on the identified shortcomings of the test suite, we implement the test
    result framework Dummy. We explore some of the additional possibilities
    created by the usage of Dummy, and provide a plan to improve DWARV’s test
    suite. We conclude with an analysis of the results that show the advantages
    of the implemented test framework and proposed test plan.
